#An Othello AI written in C++

=======

The game of Othello is played with black and white disks as documented on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi). This project is a command line (ASCII) version of the game. The AI for the game implements a minimax A\* search with iterative deepening. The heuristic function for the game accounts for the number of pieces, edge count, corners, mobility, and frontier pieces.
